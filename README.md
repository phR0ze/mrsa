# Usage

### Rustc requirements
This minimum rustc requirement is driven by the enhancements made to [Rust's `std::error::Error`
handling improvements](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html#method.source)

# Contribute
Pull requests are always welcome. However understand that they will be evaluated purely on whether
or not the change fits with my goals/ideals for the project.

### Automatic version
Enable the git hooks to have the version automatically incremented on commits

```bash
cd ~/Projects/mrsa
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## Testing

### Test in container
TBD
